COVID DASH APP

The Working of app solely depends on API to get realtime data.
API - https://api.covid19india.org/
There are few changes in there API which takes place regularly
Which may lead to small impact on My dash app
I would not suggest you go through covid19india.org's CSV (DATASET) or JSON because it contains lots of unwanted data and does not contain longitude & latitude  on Each District.
If you prefer that please edit the json and remove unwanted DATA.
So plz check my COVID19_TRACKER repository for more info.
